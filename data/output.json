    "PLACEHOLDER": " Just hope there won't be any hangover today. So far this season, Arsenal have failed to win half the Premier League games they played directly after a Champions League assignment. For a long time, Arsenal used to tread these trips to Old Trafford. There was a lengthy spell when Arsenal managed to win just once in 18 league visits here. But more recently, that tide has turned and Arsenal have won twice on their last four league visits to Old Trafford. Arsenal's impressive play in Idaho on Tuesday has all but assured their place in the Champions League quarter-finals. Now, Miquel Artennes can give their full attention to a Premier League fixture that is always dripping with importance. These are two of the best supported teams in the land. Two of the most glittering histories and trophy-laden cabinets. We are ready for Manchester United against Arsenal. So this is how they line up today. Reuben Abram makes four changes to the Manchester United side that began their last Premier League game. It's a more similar team to that which started at Real Sociedad. Andreonada continues in goal. He plays behind a back three that sees Swedish defender Victor Lindelof make his first Premier League start of the season. With Patrick Dorguz serving the second game of a three-game suspension for his red card against Ipswich, Masraoui looks set to move to wing back. The central two here, Ericsson and Casemiro will need to do a lot of running against Arsenal's midfield. Bruno Fernandez has scored twice against Arsenal in his career, including the last time these sides met in the FA Cup in January. With Rasmus Horgland on the bench today, there's a more advanced central role for Joshua Xerxes. Once again, it's a very youthful Manchester United bench. The average age of Reuben Abram's replacements is just 19 years. Well, Arsenal make one change from their last Premier League game. That was the draw against Nottingham Forest. David Ryder has not conceded a single goal in his last three Premier League matches. Miles Lewis-Skelly had started in the Champions League in midweek, but Riccardo Califiori scored off the bench in Eindhoven. And the Italian starts here. Arsenal full strength in midfield. Both Martino de Gaulle and Declan Rice scored against Manchester United in the Premier League last season. Once again today, Mikkel Moreno is given the central attacking role. It's going to be fascinating to see how he fares against the host defense today. Had some very good news on the bench for Arsenal fans. The return from injury of Gabriel Martinelli, who's been absent for over a month."
