      "brilliance": "I think he's been brilliant in this opening spell of the game. He's finding space, darting all over the pitch.",

      "rescue_play": "Brilliant work by NAME to get back and make the challenge just when NAME was sizing up the opportunity.",
      "decision_making": "The Dane looks really rusty. It should have been much quicker in the way he was going to deal with it.",
      "adaptability": "Right from the start, and I think they're kind of hybrid roles really for NAME, who's got to get wide now and again.",

      "counterattack_analysis": "We've seen a couple of promising counterattacks from TEAM 1 so far, but look how deep they are.",
      "attacking_patterns": "For TEAM 2 at the moment, it's kind of in these positions, space, space, and then as soon as they advance ten yards, where's the space? There is none.",

      "controversial_decision": "Well, it looks like he's given the decision TEAM 2's way. It looked like a coming together when I first saw it, but the referee obviously feels that there was more to it than that.",
